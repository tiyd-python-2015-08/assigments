    "## Ground Cricket Chirps\n",
    "\n",
    "In _The Song of Insects_ (1948) by George W. Pierce, Pierce mechanically measured the frequency (the number of wing vibrations per second) of chirps (or pulses of sound) made by a striped ground cricket, at various ground temperatures.  Since crickets are ectotherms (cold-blooded), the rate of their physiological processes and their overall metabolism are influenced by temperature.  Consequently, there is reason to believe that temperature would have a profound effect on aspects of their behavior, such as chirp frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it was found that crickets did not sing at temperatures colder than 60&deg; F or warmer than 100&deg; F."
